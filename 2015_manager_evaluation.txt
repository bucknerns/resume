Manager Evaluation
Comment
Technical Ability:
Nathan is a Top Notch Technical SDT and Key Player in my team. He is excellent in all aspects of Software Development be it design, development, code reviews, code analysis, framework development etc. He is excellent in understanding and solving problems at a very fast pace and he has helped in the developmental efforts of Capacity Dashboard, Nova Design Refactor. He has practically trained almost all the SDTs that joined rackspace in 2015 and through 2016 through his onboarding class. He is the core developer for syntribos, the security tool written using opencafe concepts and this framework got accepted into openstack community.
Ownership:
When something is given to nathan, What ever it may be he owns it and makes sure he delivers it quick and with highest quality. I feel very comfortable approaching Nathan as a manager with any challenging work and still feel good that it gets done no matter what. He has done it many times and very proud of this.
TeamPlayer:
Nathan is a very good team player and he continues to be. He works well with peers and teams that he interacts with. He is always on top list to help other be it in design, development or via code reviews.

Nathan is a very strong SDT in my Tools Team and he is well rounded in all the aspects of software development life cycle. He is very adaptive of situations and jumping in where ever help is needed and he has done many times. Nathan made significant  improvements in personality development and has grown into a well rounded Senior SDT on whom i can rely a lot. As a manager i am proud of Nathan's work and his work ethic.
